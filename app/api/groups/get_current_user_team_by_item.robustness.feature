      | 13 | User  |
      | 14 | User  |
      | 15 | User  |

  Scenario: Invalid item_id
    Given I am the user with id "19"
    When I send a GET request to "/current-user/teams/by-item/abc"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for item_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: Not a team member
    Given I am the user with id "11"
    When I send a GET request to "/current-user/teams/by-item/100"
    Then the response code should be 404
    And the response error message should contain "No team for this item"

  Scenario: Wrong groups.type
    Given I am the user with id "19"
    When I send a GET request to "/current-user/teams/by-item/100"
    Then the response code should be 404
    And the response error message should contain "No team for this item"

  Scenario: No team for item
    Given I am the user with id "19"
    When I send a GET request to "/current-user/teams/by-item/101"
    Then the response code should be 404
    And the response error message should contain "No team for this item"
