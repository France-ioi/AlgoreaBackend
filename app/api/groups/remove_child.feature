Feature: Remove a direct parent-child relation between two groups
  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id | name    | type  |
      | 11 | Group A | Class |
      | 13 | Group B | Class |
      | 14 | Group C | Class |
      | 21 | Self    | User  |
      | 22 | Group   | Class |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login | group_id | first_name  | last_name |
      | owner | 21       | Jean-Michel | Blanquer  |
    And the database has the following table 'group_managers':
      | group_id | manager_id | can_manage  |
      | 13       | 21         | memberships |
      | 14       | 21         | none        |
      | 22       | 21         | memberships |
    And the database has the following table 'groups_groups':
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |
      | 13              | 11             |
      | 22              | 11             |

      | 22              | 14             |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table 'group_pending_requests':
      | group_id | member_id | type       |
      | 13       | 11        | invitation |
      | 22       | 11        | invitation |
      | 22       | 13        | invitation |
      | 22       | 14        | invitation |
    And the database has the following table 'group_membership_changes':
      | group_id | member_id |
      | 13       | 11        |
      | 22       | 11        |
      | 22       | 13        |
      | 22       | 14        |

  Scenario: User deletes a relation
