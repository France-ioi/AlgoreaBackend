Feature: Remove user batch (userBatchRemove) - robustness
  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id | name                      | type  | require_lock_membership_approval_until |
      | 13 | class                     | Class | null                                   |

      | 27 | test1_custom_another_user | User  | null                                   |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login                     | group_id |

      | test_custom_another_user  | 23       |
      | test_custom_user          | 22       |
    And the database has the following table 'group_managers':
      | group_id | manager_id | can_manage  |
      | 13       | 13         | memberships |
      | 13       | 22         | none        |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table 'groups_groups':
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id | lock_membership_approved_at |

    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table 'user_batch_prefixes':

  Scenario Outline: User batch doesn't exist
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/user-batches/<group_prefix>/<custom_prefix>"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "user_batches" should stay unchanged
    And the table "users" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups" should stay unchanged
  Examples:
    | group_prefix | custom_prefix |
    | unknown      | custom        |
    | test         | unknown       |

  Scenario: The current user cannot manage the group linked to the batch prefix
    Given I am the user with id "22"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/user-batches/test/custom"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "user_batches" should stay unchanged
    And the table "users" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: There are some users with locked membership that the current user cannot manage
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/user-batches/test/custom"
    Then the response code should be 422
    And the response error message should contain "There are users with locked membership"
    And the table "user_batches" should stay unchanged
    And the table "users" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups" should stay unchanged
    And logs should contain:
      """
      User with group_id = 21 failed to delete a user batch because of locked membership (group_prefix = 'test', custom_prefix = 'custom')
      """

  Scenario: Login moudule fails
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    And the login module "delete" endpoint with params "prefix=test1_custom_" returns 200 with encoded body:
      """
      {"success": false, "error": "some error"}
      """
    When I send a DELETE request to "/user-batches/test1/custom"
    Then the response code should be 500
    And the response error message should contain "Login module failed"
    And the table "user_batches" should stay unchanged
    And the table "users" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups" should stay unchanged
    And logs should contain:
