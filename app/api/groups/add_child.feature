Feature: Add a parent-child relation between two groups

  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id | name    | type  |
      | 11 | Group A | Class |
      | 13 | Group B | Class |
      | 14 | Group C | Class |
      | 21 | Self    | User  |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login | temp_user | group_id | first_name  | last_name | allow_subgroups |
      | owner | 0         | 21       | Jean-Michel | Blanquer  | 1               |
    And the database has the following table 'group_managers':
      | group_id | manager_id | can_manage            |
      | 11       | 21         | memberships_and_group |
      | 13       | 21         | memberships           |
      | 14       | 21         | memberships_and_group |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table 'items':
      | id | default_language_tag |
      | 20 | fr                   |
      | 30 | fr                   |
    And the database has the following table 'items_ancestors':
      | ancestor_item_id | child_item_id |
      | 20               | 30            |
    And the database has the following table 'items_items':
      | parent_item_id | child_item_id | child_order |
      | 20             | 30            | 1           |
    And the database has the following table 'permissions_generated':
      | group_id | item_id | can_view_generated |
      | 13       | 20      | content            |
      | 21       | 30      | content            |
    And the database has the following table 'attempts':
      | id | participant_id |
      | 0  | 11             |
    And the database has the following table 'results':
      | attempt_id | participant_id | item_id |
      | 0          | 11             | 30      |

  Scenario: User is a manager of the two groups, has the needed permissions, and is allowed to create sub-groups
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/groups/13/relations/11"
    Then the response code should be 201
    And the response body should be, in JSON:
    """
    {
      "success": true,
      "message": "created"
    }
    """
    And the table "groups_groups" should be:
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |
      | 13              | 11             |
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should be:
      | ancestor_group_id | child_group_id | is_self |
      | 11                | 11             | 1       |
      | 13                | 11             | 0       |
