Feature: Remove a direct parent-child relation between two groups - robustness
  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':

      | 23 | teacher  | User  |
      | 53 | AllUsers | Base  |
      | 55 | User     | User  |
    And the database has the following table 'users':

    And the groups ancestors are computed

  Scenario: Parent group id is wrong
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/abc/relations/11"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for parent_group_id (should be int64)"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group id is missing
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/13/relations/abc"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for child_group_id (should be int64)"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: delete_orphans is wrong
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/13/relations/11?delete_orphans=abc"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for delete_orphans (should have a boolean value (0 or 1))"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: User is a manager of the child group, but is not a manager of the parent group
    Given I am the user with id "23"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/13/relations/11"

    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: User is a manager of the two groups, but doesn't have enough rights on the parent group
    Given I am the user with id "23"

    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: User does not exist
    Given I am the user with id "404"

    Then the response code should be 401
    And the response error message should contain "Invalid access token"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group is AllUsers group
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/13/relations/53"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group is User
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/13/relations/55"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Parent group is User
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/55/relations/14"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Parent group is Team
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/15/relations/55"

    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Parent and child are the same
    Given I am the user with id "21"

    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Relation doesn't exist
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a DELETE request to "/groups/16/relations/11"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged
