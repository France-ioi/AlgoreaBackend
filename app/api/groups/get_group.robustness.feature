  Scenario: Should fail when group_id is invalid
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/abc"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for group_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: Should fail when the group is not visible
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/13"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: Should fail when the user doesn't exist
    Given I am the user with id "404"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/13"
    Then the response code should be 401
    And the response error message should contain "Invalid access token"

  Scenario: Should fail when group_id is a user
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/21"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: Should fail when group_id is a contest participants group
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/22"
