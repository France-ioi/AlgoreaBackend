Feature: Accept requests to leave a group - robustness
  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id  | type    | frozen_membership |
      | 11  | Class   | false             |
      | 13  | Team    | false             |

      | 161 | User    | false             |
      | 444 | Team    | false             |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login | group_id | first_name  | last_name | grade |
      | owner | 21       | Jean-Michel | Blanquer  | 3     |
    And the database has the following table 'groups_groups':
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |
      | 13              | 31             |
      | 13              | 111            |

      | 14              | 151            |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table 'group_pending_requests':
      | group_id | member_id | type          |
      | 13       | 21        | invitation    |

      | group_id | manager_id | can_manage  |
      | 14       | 21         | memberships |

  Scenario: Fails when the user is not a manager of the parent group
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/groups/13/leave-requests/accept?group_ids=31,141,21,11,13"

  Scenario: Fails when the parent group id is wrong
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/groups/abc/leave-requests/accept?group_ids=31,141,21,11,13"
