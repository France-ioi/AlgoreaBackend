Feature: Invite users - robustness
  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id  | type  |
      | 11  | User  |
      | 13  | Class |
      | 21  | User  |
      | 22  | User  |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login | group_id | first_name  | last_name |
      | owner | 21       | Jean-Michel | Blanquer  |
      | user  | 11       | John        | Doe       |
      | jane  | 22       | Jane        | Doe       |
    And the database has the following table 'group_managers':
      | group_id | manager_id | can_manage  |
      | 13       | 21         | memberships |
      | 13       | 22         | none        |
      | 22       | 22         | memberships |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
