  Scenario: User is not able to watch group members
    Given I am the user with id "11"

    Then the response code should be 400

    Given I am the user with id "21"

    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: can_view < content on item_id for a user
