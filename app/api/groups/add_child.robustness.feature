Feature: Add a parent-child relation between two groups - robustness

  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id | name     | type  |
      | 11 | Group A  | Class |
      | 13 | Group B  | Class |
      | 16 | AllUsers | Base  |
      | 18 | User     | User  |
      | 19 | Team     | Team  |
      | 21 | owner    | User  |
      | 25 | student  | User  |
      | 27 | admin    | User  |
      | 77 | Group C  | Class |
      | 78 | Group D  | Class |
      | 79 | Group E  | Class |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login   | group_id | first_name  | last_name |
      | owner   | 21       | Jean-Michel | Blanquer  |
      | student | 25       | Jane        | Doe       |
      | admin   | 27       | John        | Doe       |
    And the database has the following table 'group_managers':
      | group_id | manager_id | can_manage            |
      | 11       | 21         | memberships_and_group |
      | 13       | 21         | memberships           |
      | 78       | 21         | memberships           |
      | 79       | 21         | none                  |
      | 11       | 25         | memberships           |
      | 11       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 13       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 16       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 18       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 19       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
    And the database has the following table 'groups_groups':
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |
      | 13              | 11             |
    And the groups ancestors are computed

  Scenario: Parent group id is wrong
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/groups/abc/relations/11"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for parent_group_id (should be int64)"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group id is missing
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/groups/13/relations/abc"

  Scenario: User is a manager of the two groups, but doesn't have enough rights on the child group
    Given I am the user with id "21"

    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group is AllUsers groups
    Given I am the user with id "27"

    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group is User
    Given I am the user with id "27"

    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Parent group is User

  Scenario: A group cannot become an ancestor of itself

    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "A group cannot become an ancestor of itself"
    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Parent and child are the same
    Given I am the user with id "27"
