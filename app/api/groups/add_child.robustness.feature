Feature: Add a parent-child relation between two groups - robustness

  Background:
    Given the database has the following table "groups":
      | id | name     | type  |
      | 11 | Group A  | Class |
      | 13 | Group B  | Class |
      | 16 | AllUsers | Base  |
      | 18 | User     | User  |
      | 19 | Team     | Team  |
      | 21 | owner    | User  |
      | 25 | student  | User  |
      | 27 | admin    | User  |
      | 77 | Group C  | Class |
      | 78 | Group D  | Class |
      | 79 | Group E  | Class |
    And the database has the following table "users":
      | login   | group_id | first_name  | last_name |
      | owner   | 21       | Jean-Michel | Blanquer  |
      | student | 25       | Jane        | Doe       |
      | admin   | 27       | John        | Doe       |
    And the database has the following table "group_managers":
      | group_id | manager_id | can_manage            |
      | 11       | 21         | memberships_and_group |
      | 13       | 21         | memberships           |
      | 78       | 21         | memberships           |
      | 79       | 21         | none                  |
      | 11       | 25         | memberships           |
      | 11       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 13       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 16       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 18       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
      | 19       | 27         | memberships_and_group |
    And the database has the following table "groups_groups":
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |
      | 13              | 11             |
    And the groups ancestors are computed

  Scenario: Parent group id is wrong
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/groups/abc/relations/11"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for parent_group_id (should be int64)"

    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group id is missing
    Given I am the user with id "21"

  Scenario: Child group is AllUsers groups
    Given I am the user with id "27"

    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Child group is User
    Given I am the user with id "27"

  Scenario: A group cannot become an ancestor of itself

    And the table "groups_groups" should stay unchanged
    And the table "groups_ancestors" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Parent and child are the same
    Given I am the user with id "27"
