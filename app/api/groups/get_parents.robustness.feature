    And the groups ancestors are computed

  Scenario: Group id is incorrect
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/abc/parents"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for group_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: User manages a only a user-group that is a descendant of the group
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/159/parents"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: The user doesn't manage any of the group's ancestors/descendants, is not a member of the group's descendants, the group is not public
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/21/parents"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: sort is incorrect
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a GET request to "/groups/400/parents?sort=myname"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Unallowed field in sorting parameters: "myname""
