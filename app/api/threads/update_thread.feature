      | 2022-01-01 00:00:00 | <status> | <helper_group_id> |

  Scenario Outline: Participant of a thread can switch from non-open to open status when allowed to request help on the item when thread doesn't exists
    Given I am the user with id "3"
    And I can watch none on item with id "<item_id>"
    And there is no thread with "item_id=<item_id>,participant_id=3"
    When I send a PUT request to "/items/<item_id>/participant/3/thread" with the following body:
      """
      {
        "status": "<status>",
        "helper_group_id": <helper_group_id>
      }
      """
    Then the response should be "updated"
    And the table "threads" should stay unchanged but the row with item_id "<item_id>"
    And the table "threads" at item_id "<item_id>" should be:
      | latest_update_at    | status   | helper_group_id   |
      | 2022-01-01 00:00:00 | <status> | <helper_group_id> |
    Examples:
      | item_id | status                  | helper_group_id | comment    |
      | 2002    | waiting_for_trainer     | 11              |            |
