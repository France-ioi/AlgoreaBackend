  Scenario: Should fail when the user has only grayed access to the item
    Given I am the user with ID "1"
    When I send a GET request to "/answers?attempt_id=110"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: Should fail when the user doesn't have access to the item
    Given I am the user with ID "1"
    When I send a GET request to "/answers?attempt_id=100"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: Should fail when the attempt doesn't exist
    Given I am the user with ID "1"
    When I send a GET request to "/answers?attempt_id=400"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: Should fail when the authenticated user is not a member of the group and not an owner of the group attached to the attempt
    Given I am the user with ID "2"
    When I send a GET request to "/answers?attempt_id=100"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"
