  Scenario: Invalid item_id
    Given I am the user with id "11"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/1111111111111111111111111111/current-answer?attempt_id=1"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for item_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: Invalid attempt_id
    Given I am the user with id "11"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/200/current-answer?attempt_id=abc"

  Scenario: Invalid as_team_id
    Given I am the user with id "11"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/200/current-answer?as_team_id=abc&attempt_id=1"

    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for as_team_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: User doesn't have sufficient access rights to the item
    Given I am the user with id "11"

    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: No current answer for the item and the attempt
    Given I am the user with id "11"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/210/current-answer?attempt_id=1"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: User is not a member of the team
    Given I am the user with id "11"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/210/current-answer?as_team_id=13&attempt_id=1"
