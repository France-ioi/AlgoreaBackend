  Scenario: User is able to save an answer
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/50/attempts/1/answers" with the following body:
      """
      {
        "answer": "print 1",
        "state": "some state"
      }
      """
    Then the response code should be 201
    And the response body should be, in JSON:
      """
      {
        "message": "created",
        "success": true
      }
      """
    And the table "answers" should be:
      | author_id | attempt_id | participant_id | item_id | type       | answer  | state      | ABS(TIMESTAMPDIFF(SECOND, created_at, NOW())) < 3 |
