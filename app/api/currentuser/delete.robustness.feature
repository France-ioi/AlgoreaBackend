Feature: Delete the current user - robustness
  Background:
    Given the DB time now is "2019-08-09 23:59:59"
    And the database has the following table "groups":
      | id | type  | name         | require_lock_membership_approval_until |
      | 2  | Base  | AllUsers     | null                                   |

      | 4  | Base  | TempUsers    | null                                   |
      | 21 | User  | user         | null                                   |
      | 50 | Class | Our class    | 2019-08-10 00:00:00                    |
    And the database has the following table "groups_groups":
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id | lock_membership_approved_at |
      | 2               | 3              | null                        |

    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following user:
