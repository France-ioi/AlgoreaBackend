Feature: Create an attempt for an item - robustness
  Background:
    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id  | type  | root_activity_id | root_skill_id |
      | 101 | User  | null             | null          |
      | 102 | Team  | null             | null          |

      | 104 | Team  | 50               | 90            |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login | group_id |
      | john  | 101      |
    And the database has the following table 'groups_groups':
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |

      | 104             | 101            |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table 'items':
      | id | url                                                                     | type   | allows_multiple_attempts | default_language_tag |

      | 101      | 50      | info               |
      | 101      | 60      | content            |
      | 101      | 90      | content            |

  Scenario: Invalid item ids
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/11111111111111111111111111111/222222222222/attempts?parent_attempt_id=0"

  Scenario: No access to the item (no item)
    Given I am the user with id "101"

    And the table "attempts" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: There is an attempt for the (group, item) pair already, but items.allows_multiple_attempts = 0
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    And the database table 'permissions_generated' has also the following row:
      | group_id | item_id | can_view_generated |
      | 104      | 50      | content            |
    And the database has the following table 'attempts':
      | id | participant_id |
      | 0  | 104            |
    And the database has the following table 'results':
      | attempt_id | participant_id | item_id | started_at          |
      | 0          | 104            | 50      | 2019-05-30 11:00:00 |
    When I send a POST request to "/items/50/attempts?as_team_id=104&parent_attempt_id=0"
    Then the response code should be 422
    And the response error message should contain "The item doesn't allow multiple attempts"
    And the table "attempts" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Not enough permissions for the last item in the path
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    And the database table 'permissions_generated' has also the following row:
      | group_id | item_id | can_view_generated |
      | 104      | 50      | info               |
