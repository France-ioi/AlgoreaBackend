    Given the database has the following table 'groups':
      | id  | type  | root_activity_id | root_skill_id |
      | 101 | User  | 70               | null          |
      | 102 | Team  | null             | null          |

      | 104 | Team  | 50               | 90            |
    And the database has the following table 'users':
      | login | group_id |
      | john  | 101      |
    And the database has the following table 'groups_groups':
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |

      | 104             | 101            |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table 'items':
      | id | url                                                                     | type   | allows_multiple_attempts | default_language_tag | requires_explicit_entry |

    And the database has the following table 'permissions_generated':
      | group_id | item_id | can_view_generated |
      | 101      | 50      | none               |

    And the database has the following table 'attempts':
      | participant_id | id |
      | 101            | 0  |

  Scenario: Invalid item id
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/11111111111111111111111111111/path-from-root?attempt_id=0"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for item_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: Invalid as_team_id
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/50/path-from-root?as_team_id=abc"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for as_team_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: User not found
    Given I am the user with id "404"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/50/path-from-root"
    Then the response code should be 401

  Scenario: No access to the item (no item)
    Given I am the user with id "101"

  Scenario: No access to the item
    Given I am the user with id "101"

    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: No access to the item (as a team)
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/50/path-from-root?as_team_id=104"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: User is not a team member
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/60/path-from-root?as_team_id=102"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Can't use given as_team_id as a user's team"

  Scenario: as_team_id is not a team
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a GET request to "/items/60/path-from-root?as_team_id=103"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Can't use given as_team_id as a user's team"

  Scenario: No path
    Given I am the user with id "101"
