Feature: Start results for an item path - robustness
  Background:
    Given the database has the following table "groups":
      | id  | type  | root_activity_id | root_skill_id |
      | 101 | User  | 70               | null          |
      | 102 | Team  | null             | null          |
      | 103 | Class | 50               | 90            |
      | 104 | Team  | 50               | 90            |
    And the database has the following table "users":
      | login | group_id |
      | john  | 101      |
    And the database has the following table "groups_groups":
      | parent_group_id | child_group_id |

      | 104             | 101            |
    And the groups ancestors are computed
    And the database has the following table "items":
      | id | url                                                                     | type   | allows_multiple_attempts | default_language_tag | requires_explicit_entry |

    And the database has the following table "permissions_generated":
      | group_id | item_id | can_view_generated |
      | 101      | 50      | info               |
      | 101      | 60      | content            |

      | 101      | 90      | content            |
    And the database has the following table "attempts":
      | participant_id | id |
      | 101            | 0  |

    And the response error message should contain "Invalid access token"
    And the table "results" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: No access to the item (no item)
    Given I am the user with id "101"

    And the table "results" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: No access to the item (info access)
    Given I am the user with id "101"

    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/60/start-result-path?as_team_id=103"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Can't use given as_team_id as a user's team"
