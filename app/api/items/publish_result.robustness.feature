  Scenario: Invalid item_id
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/abc/attempts/1/publish"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for item_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: The current user has no login_id
    Given I am the user with id "31"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/123/attempts/1/publish"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: The current user has no content permission on the item
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/124/attempts/1/publish"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Insufficient access rights"

  Scenario: Invalid attempt_id
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/123/attempts/abc/publish"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for attempt_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: Invalid as_team_id
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/123/attempts/1/publish?as_team_id=abc"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "Wrong value for as_team_id (should be int64)"

  Scenario: as_team_id is not a user's team
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/123/attempts/1/publish?as_team_id=99"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Can't use given as_team_id as a user's team"

  Scenario: as_team_id is a user's team, but team work is not supported
    Given I am the user with id "21"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/123/attempts/1/publish?as_team_id=100"
    Then the response code should be 400
    And the response error message should contain "The service doesn't support 'as_team_id'"
