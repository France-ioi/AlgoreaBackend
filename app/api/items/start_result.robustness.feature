  Scenario: as_team_id is not a team
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    When I send a POST request to "/items/60/start-result?as_team_id=103&attempt_id=0"
    Then the response code should be 403
    And the response error message should contain "Can't use given as_team_id as a user's team"
    And the table "attempts" should stay unchanged

  Scenario: Not enough permissions for the last item in the path
    Given I am the user with id "101"
    And the database table 'permissions_generated' has also the following row:
      | group_id | item_id | can_view_generated |
      | 104      | 50      | info               |
